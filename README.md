## Introduction
RFM analysis is a powerful tool used to categorize customers based on three key factors: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value. This project uses automobile sales data to help businesses better understand their customer base, identify their most valuable customers, and craft personalized marketing strategies.

## Overview
The dataset used in this project contains detailed sales information from an automobile company. Attributes such as order number, date, product details, and customer purchase data are analyzed. By segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies to improve customer retention and sales.

## Tools
This project utilizes Python and popular data science libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis. We also make use of visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to graphically represent the RFM segmentation results.

## Methods
The dataset undergoes several preprocessing steps, including data cleaning and transformation, followed by the calculation of **RFM scores** for each customer. Each customer is assigned a score based on how recently they purchased, how often they purchase, and how much they spend.

## Algorithms
We compute **RFM scores** and apply clustering algorithms, such as K-Means, to categorize customers into segments. Each customer is assigned a score between 1 and 5 for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value. These scores are then used to group customers into distinct segments for better marketing targeting.

## Results
The results show the identification of high-value customer segments based on RFM scores. These insights allow businesses to develop personalized marketing campaigns, focus retention efforts on loyal customers, and potentially increase future revenue.
